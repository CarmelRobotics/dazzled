`dazzled` arduino code project

This project implements the code to handle LEDs and network communication traffic from our First Robotics Competition Robot.

This project is being used on an [Arduino Ethernet][arduino] board.  A to-be-named robot code project will communicate with `dazzled` and provide it with the information from the robot game.

This project will implement several LED light patterns for fun and several patterns to act as a driver station heads-up display.

Our Hardware
============

* Arduino ethernet
* RGB-123 brand 1x8 LEDs (using WS2812 LEDs)
* WS2811 LEDs
* [PixyCam] [pixycam] (CMUCam5) waiting for this to be released
